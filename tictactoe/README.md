Instructions
Create a one-player Tic Tac Toe game. The program should first randomly select whether the human player or 
the computer player gets to go first. Every time that someone takes a turn, be sure to update the grid afterwards.
Your game should be able to determine when somebody wins or when there is a tie.
Some things that your AI player should look out for are moves that would cause it to win, 
moves that would block the human player from immediately winning, 
and optimal board locations (the center is one of the most advantageous, followed by the corners).


I have used the followng concets
variables, loops, lists (2D), functions, conditions, user input, game logic and error handling
